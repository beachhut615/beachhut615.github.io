Holy charcoal smokes, everyone. A rechargeable AUTOMATED grill brush. Seriously, no more endless scrubbing or worrying about those rogue wire bristles. It cleans your grill in seconds. The Horsepower Giddy Up is a game-changer for anyone who loves to grill but dreads the cleaning.

<p id="post-quote"> This sure cleaned the grill grates. I have only used it once, but was impressed with it - Amazon Customer</p> <br />
